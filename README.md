# Image Converter

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment. Use the included `venv_create.bat` to automatically create it.
2. Install the libraries in requirements.txt. `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This is optionally done by step 1 when asked if you use `venv_create.bat`.
3. Run `imageconverter.bat` or `py imageconverter.py`.
